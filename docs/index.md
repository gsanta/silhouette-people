## Hole

**Holes** are doors to the **Otherworld** from where **Silhouette People** are being spawn continuously. They appear on crime scenes,
usually in abandoned places like **Parks** and **Abandoned streets**.
**The Library** is the best source to get informed about recent crimes and they are good hints where to look for **Holes**.

Holes need to be sealed to stop producing enemies, the longer they are open, the more and stronger silhouette people are flooding the area.

To seal a Hole, the Player has to enter the Hole and go to Otherworld to fight the **Guards** of the Hole.

## Otherworld

In **Otherworld** each Player has a special ability that can be used during the fight.

# Moving around

There are multiple forms of moving around in the game. The simplest and slowest is **Walking**. A faster way of moving is using a **Bicycle**. Walking and cycling is mainly useful within a **District**, however they can be used to travel to another district, but it takes quite a long time.

The best way to travel between two districts is to catch a **Bus**.

## Bicycle

**Bicycles** can be used to move faster within **Districts**.

Bicycle features:
* Number of gears - the more gears the bike has, it can go faster
* Weight - the lighter the bike, the faster, but it is also less stable
* Maintenance

The **Number of gears** feature determines the top speed of the bike and what is the steepest hill it is able to climb. It can be upgraded in the **Bike shop** where each time the number of gears is increased by 1 until the maximum number of gears (11) is reached. Upgrading the bike costs **Pocket money**.

**Maintenance** has to be done periodically, preferably before the maintenance number reaches 0. When it reaches 0, the bike is not operational anymore until it is taken to the **Bike shop** and repared. Maintenance costs **Pocket money**.

## Bus

**Buses** are traveling between **Districts**.
