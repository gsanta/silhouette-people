## Hole

**Holes** are doors to the **Otherworld** from where **Silhouette People** are being spawn continuously. They appear on crime scenes,
usually in abandoned places like **Parks** and **Abandoned streets**.
**The Library** is the best source to get informed about recent crimes and they are good hints where to look for **Holes**.

Holes need to be sealed to stop producing enemies, the longer they are open, the more and stronger silhouette people are flooding the area.

To seal a Hole, the Player has to enter the Hole and go to Otherworld to fight the **Guards** of the Hole.

## Otherworld

In **Otherworld** each Player has a special ability that can be used during the fight.
